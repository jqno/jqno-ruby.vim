These are my personal Ruby settings for VIM.

Normal mode mappings
---

Binding | Description
------- | -----------
&lt;LocalLeader&gt;rm | Designate the file in the current buffer 'main file'. Every subsequent run will use this file, instead of the file in the then-current buffer.
&lt;LocalLeader&gt;rM | Echo the current main file.
&lt;LocalLeader&gt;rr | Run the main file, or the current file if no main file is set.
